# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This PoC demonstrates a comprehensive benchmark comparing a modern Python-native ETL stack (Polars, DuckDB, PyIceberg, PyArrow) against traditional Spark-based ETL pipelines. The goal is to provide tangible evidence of when lightweight Python tools can outperform Spark, challenging the default assumption that Spark is always the optimal choice for ETL workloads. The benchmark will run across different data scales and environments (local and AWS/Kubernetes) to showcase performance characteristics and operational simplicity differences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to compare ETL performance between Spark and Python-native tools across different data sizes, so that I can make informed decisions about technology stack selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the benchmark runs THEN the system SHALL execute identical ETL logic using both Spark and Python-native implementations
2. WHEN processing different data volumes (small, medium, large) THEN the system SHALL measure and record execution time, memory usage, and resource consumption for each approach
3. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL generate comparative performance reports showing clear metrics differences
4. IF data size is below a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL demonstrate scenarios where Python-native tools outperform Spark

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy and run benchmarks on both local machines and Kubernetes clusters, so that I can evaluate performance across different infrastructure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL support Docker Compose orchestration for both ETL approaches
2. WHEN deploying on Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide Helm charts or YAML manifests for both Spark and Python-native pipelines
3. WHEN running on AWS THEN the system SHALL utilize appropriate cloud services (EKS, S3, etc.) and measure cloud-specific performance characteristics
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent benchmark logic while adapting to infrastructure differences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want comprehensive benchmark results and analysis, so that I can create compelling content demonstrating when each approach is optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed performance reports with visualizations
2. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL identify clear use cases where each technology stack excels
3. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL provide reproducible benchmark instructions and configuration
4. IF performance differences are significant THEN the system SHALL highlight specific scenarios and data characteristics that favor each approach

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data platform architect, I want to test realistic ETL scenarios with different data characteristics, so that I can understand performance implications across various workload types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining test scenarios THEN the system SHALL include common ETL operations (filtering, aggregations, joins, transformations)
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL support multiple data formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON) and storage systems (local files, S3, Iceberg tables)
3. WHEN scaling data THEN the system SHALL test with datasets ranging from MB to GB scale to identify performance crossover points
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL capture startup time, processing time, memory usage, and resource efficiency metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easily configurable benchmark parameters, so that I can customize tests for specific scenarios and data characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring benchmarks THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of data size, complexity, and processing parameters
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support different data generation patterns and ETL complexity levels
3. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL enable side-by-side execution with identical input data and logic
4. IF custom scenarios are needed THEN the system SHALL provide extensible framework for adding new benchmark cases
