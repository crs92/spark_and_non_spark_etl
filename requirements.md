## Requirements for "Modern ETL Stack" Proof of Concept

This document outlines the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements for the Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to evaluate a modern, Python-native ETL stack against the existing Spark-based framework.

### Functional Requirements

These define what the system must do.

    F.1 Data Ingestion: The system must be able to ingest structured data from flat files (CSV or parquet format).

    F.2 Data Transformation: The system must perform the following transformations on the input clickstream data:

        F.2.1 Data Cleansing: Handle null values and perform correct data type casting.

        F.2.2 Data Enrichment: Derive a user's country from their IP address.

        F.2.3 Sessionization: Group user events into distinct sessions based on a 30-minute inactivity window, generating a unique session_id for each session.

    F.3 Data Loading: The system must write the transformed data into a data lakehouse using an open table format (Apache Iceberg).

    F.4 Pipeline Equivalence: Both the Pythonic stack and the Spark stack implementations must execute the exact same business logic to ensure a fair comparison.

    F.5 Analytical Queries: The system must allow for analytical SQL queries to be run against the final transformed data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

These define how well the system must perform.

    NF.1 Performance: The system's performance must be measured and compared across both stacks. Key metrics include:

        NF.1.1 Execution Time: Total wall-clock time for the ETL job to complete.

        NF.1.2 Startup Time: Time required for the environment/session to initialize before processing data.

    NF.2 Resource Efficiency: The system's resource consumption must be profiled.

        NF.2.1 Memory Usage: Peak RAM utilized during the ETL process.

        NF.2.2 CPU Usage: General CPU load during execution.

    NF.3 Scalability: The PoC must evaluate the scalability of both approaches:

        NF.3.1 Vertical Scaling: Performance on a single, large, memory-optimized machine.

        NF.3.2 Horizontal Scaling: Performance on a distributed cluster of smaller machines.

    NF.4 Cost-Effectiveness: The PoC must provide a cost-performance analysis, comparing the infrastructure costs of the vertically scaled and horizontally scaled solutions.

### Technical & Project Requirements

These define the technical and development standards for the PoC.

    T.1 Environment: The PoC must be containerized (using Docker) for reproducibility.

    T.2 Package Management: The Python environment must be managed using uv with dependencies declared in pyproject.toml.

    T.3 Code Quality: The project must enforce high code quality standards using:

        T.3.1 Linting & Formatting: Automated checks with ruff and black.

        T.3.2 Pre-commit Hooks: Automatic enforcement of checks before each commit.

    T.4 Task Automation: The project must include a Makefile to provide standardized commands for common tasks like installation, testing, and linting.

    T.5 Deliverable: The final output of the PoC will be a comprehensive report and presentation that includes:

        T.5.1 Benchmark Results: The quantitative results from all test scenarios.

        T.5.2 Decision Framework: The heuristic flowchart, refined with the PoC's findings, to guide future ETL architecture decisions.
