## Phase 6: Analysis & Reporting (T.5)

### 6A: Benchmark Analysis (T.5.1)
- [ ] Performance comparison across data sizes
- [ ] Cost-effectiveness analysis (NF.4)
- [ ] Resource utilization patterns
- [ ] Scalability characteristics comparison

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase | Activities |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | Infrastructure & environment setup |
| 2-3 | Phase 2A | Core ETL implementations (parallel development) |
| 3 | Phase 2B | Iceberg integration |
| 4 | Phase 3 + 4A | Analytics setup + monitoring framework |
| 5 | Phase 4B + 5 | Test data preparation + scalability testing |
| 6 | Phase 6 | Analysis, reporting, and deliverables |

## Key Implementation Considerations

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Non-Spark and Spark implementations can be developed simultaneously
- Infrastructure setup can overlap with initial ETL development
- Test data preparation can begin early in the process

### Test-Driven Approach
- Implement unit tests early (pytest already included in dependencies)
- Create integration tests for end-to-end pipeline validation
- Establish baseline performance metrics

### Incremental Testing Strategy
1. Start with small datasets for rapid iteration
2. Validate business logic equivalence between implementations
3. Scale up data sizes progressively
4. Monitor performance characteristics at each scale

### Documentation Requirements
- Document architectural decisions throughout development
- Record performance observations and trade-offs
- Maintain clear comparison criteria
- Document environment setup for reproducibility

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Both ETL pipelines process identical business logic
- [ ] Performance metrics collected across all test scenarios
- [ ] Scalability characteristics documented for both approaches
- [ ] Cost analysis completed for different deployment scenarios

### Business Success
- [ ] Clear decision framework for future ETL architecture choices
- [ ] Quantitative data to support technology decisions
- [ ] Reproducible benchmarking methodology
- [ ] Actionable recommendations for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data inconsistency**: Implement thorough validation between pipeline outputs
- **Performance variability**: Use multiple test runs and statistical analysis
- **Environment differences**: Containerization ensures consistent testing environments

### Project Risks
- **Timeline constraints**: Prioritize core functionality over edge cases
- **Resource limitations**: Start with smaller datasets and scale based on available resources
- **Scope creep**: Maintain focus on defined requirements and success criteria
